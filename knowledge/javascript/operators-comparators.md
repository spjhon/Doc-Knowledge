# Comparators and operators

In JavaScript, the && operator is a logical AND operator. It returns true if both operands are true, and false otherwise. Here are the possible combinations:

true && true returns true
true && false returns false
false && true returns false
false && false returns false

In JavaScript, the && operator is often used in conditional statements and expressions to ensure that multiple conditions are met before executing a certain block of code. If the left operand is false, the right operand is not even evaluated because the result will always be false regardless. This is known as short-circuit evaluation.
