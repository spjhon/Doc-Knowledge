# Comparators and operators

In JavaScript, the && operator is a logical AND operator. It returns true if both operands are true, and false otherwise. Here are the possible combinations:

- **true && true returns true**
- **true && false returns false**
- **false && true returns false**
- **false && false returns false**

In JavaScript, the && operator is often used in conditional statements and expressions to ensure that multiple conditions are met before executing a certain block of code. If the left operand is false, the right operand is not even evaluated because the result will always be false regardless. This is known as short-circuit evaluation.

## Falsy values

In JavaScript, the following values are considered falsy:

1. **false**: The boolean value `false`.

2. **0**: The number `0`, whether integer or floating-point.

3. **-0**: Negative zero, although it's rare to encounter this.

4. **0n**: BigInt zero, if you're using BigInts.

5. **"":** An empty string.

6. **null**: The absence of any value or object.

7. **undefined**: Denotes a variable that has not been assigned a value, or an object property that does not exist.

8. **NaN**: Stands for "Not a Number," usually resulting from invalid arithmetic operations or type conversion attempts.

These values are considered falsy because when coerced to a boolean, they evaluate to `false`. For example:

```javascript
if (0) {
    // This code block won't execute because 0 is falsy
    console.log("This won't be printed");
}

if (null) {
    // This code block won't execute because null is falsy
    console.log("Neither will this");
}
```

It's important to be aware of falsy values, especially when using conditional statements or evaluating expressions that might return unexpected results if you're not accounting for falsy values properly.
