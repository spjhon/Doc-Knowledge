# Freelancing Tips

## Dealing With Feelancing or Agency Clients

In the most recent client project i worked on, I asked the client to provide me access to an email address they can control under an alias of `developer@<clientdomain>.com` or similar. If they couldn't, I would have then created them one such as `<clientname>_development@gmail.com`.

Everything was created against that email address. This includes Supabase, Vercel Hosting, Sendgrid, Github, etc. All credentials are stored in a password manager.

I just did my work from there, as you would normally.

I did not provide them the details of the hosting services or credentials until the project was completed. I sent everything in a keepass file once the project was completed and paid for, with instructions on what skills they needed to find to keep maintaining the project should I die or they longer work with me.

## How to be a high value freelancer

There are plenty of people offering web development services at all kinds of rates making it seem very difficult to get started and make a decent living.

I have been in your shoes when I first started freelancing and made my fair share of mistakes.

Today I do some freelancing myself and work with freelancers on different projects.

The answer is yes, you can still make a good career as a freelancer if you follow the advice below:

### 1 You are in the business of understanding other businesses

It’s important and required from you to learn the technical side (picking a suitable programming language, best practices, solving problems)

If you stop there, what’s the difference between you and the million other freelancers?

Let’s look at a usual scenario of hiring freelance developers:

Business wants something done, they either have an idea or a detailed brief
They go on freelancers websites to find a suitable candidate
They get 100s of bids from freelancers all over the world
They will filter through them and pick the one they feel is best
The developer now gets work based on what he is told and project is delivered
What’s the problem?

The average freelancer will do what they are told only and their initial bid will only take into account the technical side of the project.

The problem: Any programmer can develop based on an idea or brief.

What should you do instead?

You should be genuinely curious about the client’s business.

What is that project for? why do they want to develop a [website/app/project] now? what’s the clients business? how do they make money? who are their customers?

Simply asking these questions puts you in the top 1 % of all bidders automatically.

Don’t just ask and then get to work as usual!

You love technology right? cool, how can you help this client improve his idea based on what you learned about their business, using technology?

Now if you propose new ideas that make sense, you are the 1% of the 1%.

At this point the price does not matter.

Which reminds me: market rates are for losers.

You are not selling a commodity, you are a consultant offering solutions — you set the market rate for yourself based on the value you offer.

### 2 You want to be a big fish in a small pond, not a small fish in a big pond

As a web developer you are competing with all the other million developers in the same pond of people looking for web developers.

What’s the problem?

You offer almost exactly the same service as everyone else, when people want to find you they are looking for a general terms such as “web developer” and that decreases your value.

How do we fix it?

What happens if we reposition your offering and say you are a web developer who specialises in boutique hotel websites?

Now we can say you are:

Competing with a much less crowd of web developers
Charging x10 more than other developers because you are offering a specialized service
In the future as you understand the market better you can develop Software as a Service and rent it out to boutique hotels.

Replace boutique hotels with any other market that makes sense to you based on who you have access to and what you personally like.

### 3 Always be adding value

When I first got into business I thought the way it works is you get clients to pay you money.

The main goal? get paid.

What’s the problem?

Your clients will end up seeing you as a cost, you are not bringing in much value and so it’s an unfair relationship.

What did I do to fix it?

Instead of thinking how to make money, I started thinking how to add value.

I now lose money on some projects but it’s okay because the clients are happy and keep coming back for more which ends up making more profit.

Want happy clients?

Always Be Adding Value.

Keep the client’s interests first, always think of how would you give them the best value? how do you make them more money? what is the best thing for them?

It’s challenging because you are sacrificing your profit margins for your client but also because constantly providing more value to clients takes a lot of work!

If you can’t do that then your competition will and sooner or later you will be out of business.

## Tips from Reddit Comments

When we are software developers, we rarely are directly responsible making
money for the company. Typically the things that we make are tools that allow those
that make money for the company to work more efficiently.

We are productivity amplifiers.

We can help companies survive in difficult times if we work on the right things.

Web Assembly could be the future in web enviroment due to the ability to run c++ and c# on the web.

.net rocks.

Dont jump into new technology if the current technology stills solve the business
probelm at the speed that the bussiness problem requires.

The future is analysing data.

Not only that, but how do you even quantify it?

You'll need to know some HTML. How many tags? Hard to say. What about W3C validation and knowing that block and inline elements are? Aria attributes? How does the `<dialog>` actually work? Does that include CSS knowledge? JavaScript? What if you need to use TypeScript?

Speaking of, what about CSS? It's not a "you know 20% of CSS so you can get a job!" type of deal. Knowing CSS is just part of the battle, choosing the correct CSS properties and values is what makes you a beginner or a master.

Browser differences? JavaScript? React? Vue? Svelte? Angular? Web components? Which of the many dozens of browser APIs? Text readers? Developer tools?

IDEs? CI/CD? Build pipelines? Git? A CSS framework? REST patterns? API design? Versioning? Back-end design principles? Visual design principles? Knowledge of UX?

State management? Routing? Event binding? Dependency injections? Unit testing, end-to-end testing, integration testing? Do you know about XPath selectors? Do you need to for an entry-level job?

It's impossible to say.

You need to be GOOD at web development in general. That takes a lot of time and effort and there's no quick and easy way to learn all of that.

I've interviewed over 500 people, and reviewed thousands of resumes and cover letters and the likes.

For every person who didn't know nearly enough, there were 20 others who knew what we were looking for. And maybe 2 or 3 of those would get an invite to interview (beyond the initial recruiter-chat) based on some trivialities.

## Documenting

DOCUMENTATION NECESARRY FOR A PROJECT

Documenting an e-commerce project built with Next.js involves capturing various aspects of your application, including code, design, architecture, and usage guidelines. Here's a list of documentation guides and the tools you can use to create them:

### Code Documentation

- **JavaScript/React Code:** Use JSDoc comments to document your JavaScript and React components.

- **CSS:** Continue using KSS (Knyle Style Sheets) for documenting your CSS styles.

- **Next.js Routing:** Document how your routing is structured using Next.js's routing system, explaining the purpose of each route.

- **Component Documentation:**Continue using Storybook to document your React components, as mentioned earlier. Storybook is excellent for showcasing and documenting UI components.

- **API Documentation:** If your e-commerce project has backend APIs, use tools like Swagger or OpenAPI to document your API endpoints, request/response structures, and authentication methods.

- **Database Schema:** Document your database schema, including tables, fields, relationships, and data types. You can use tools like Dbdiagram.io or draw your own diagrams.

- **Design and UX Guidelines:** Create design guidelines or a style guide that explains the design system, including typography, color schemes, spacing, and component usage. Tools like Figma or Adobe XD can be used for design documentation.

- **Architecture Diagrams:** Draw architectural diagrams to explain the structure of your Next.js application, including the front-end, back-end, and database components. Tools like draw.io, Lucidchart, or even diagrams in Markdown can be used for this purpose.

- **Deployment Documentation:** Document the deployment process, including the hosting platform (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, AWS), deployment scripts, and environment variables. Include instructions for setting up continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

- **User Documentation:** Create user guides or manuals for customers and administrators. Explain how to navigate the e-commerce site, make purchases, manage accounts, and perform administrative tasks. Tools like Markdown or a documentation platform (e.g., Docusaurus, MkDocs) can be used.

- **Testing and Quality Assurance:** Document your testing strategies, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. Explain how to run tests and interpret the results. Tools like Jest, Testing Library, or Cypress can be used for test documentation.

- **Performance Guidelines:** Provide guidelines on optimizing the performance of your Next.js e-commerce site. Document techniques for lazy loading, code splitting, image optimization, and caching strategies.

- **Security Guidelines:** Document security best practices for your application, including data encryption, authentication, authorization, and handling sensitive data. Include guidelines for protecting against common web security threats like XSS and CSRF.

- **Accessibility Guidelines:** Detail accessibility considerations and guidelines for ensuring your e-commerce site is accessible to all users. Use tools like Lighthouse or aXe for accessibility testing.

- **Legal and Compliance:** Document legal and compliance-related information, such as privacy policies, terms of service, and GDPR compliance (if applicable).

- **Change Log:** Maintain a change log or release notes documenting changes, bug fixes, and new features in each version of your e-commerce application.

- **Collaboration and Communication:** Specify communication channels, project management tools (e.g., Slack, Trello), and collaboration guidelines for your development team.

Remember to keep your documentation up to date as your project evolves. Regularly review and maintain your documentation to ensure that it remains accurate and valuable to your team and users.
