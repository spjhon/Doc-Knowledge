# TypeScript Features

At its core, TypeScript’s type system works by:
• Reading in your code and understanding all the types and values in existence
• For each value, seeing what type its initial declaration indicates it may contain
• For each value, seeing all the ways it’s used later on in code
• Complaining to the user if a value’s usage doesn’t match with its type

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing and other features to the language. Some of its key features include:

Static Typing: TypeScript allows developers to add static types to variables, function parameters, and return values. This helps catch type-related errors at compile time rather than runtime, leading to safer and more predictable code.

Interfaces: TypeScript supports the concept of interfaces, which allow developers to define the shape of objects. Interfaces can be used to enforce contracts within the codebase and ensure consistency.

Enums: Enums, short for enumerations, allow developers to define a set of named constants. This can make code more readable and maintainable by giving meaningful names to values.

Classes: TypeScript supports object-oriented programming features such as classes, inheritance, and access modifiers (public, private, and protected). This allows developers to structure their code in a more organized and reusable manner.

Generics: TypeScript provides support for generics, which allow for the creation of reusable components that can work with a variety of data types. Generics add flexibility and type safety to functions, classes, and interfaces.

Decorators: Decorators provide a way to add annotations and metadata to classes, methods, and properties in TypeScript. They are heavily used in frameworks like Angular for features such as dependency injection and routing.

Union Types and Intersection Types: TypeScript allows developers to create union types and intersection types, which provide powerful ways to work with multiple types. Union types allow a variable to hold values of different types, while intersection types combine multiple types into one.

Nullable Types: TypeScript introduces the concept of null and undefined as distinct types, which helps prevent common errors such as null pointer exceptions in JavaScript.

Type Inference: TypeScript's type inference system automatically deduces the types of variables when they are initialized based on the assigned values. This reduces the need for explicit type annotations, making code more concise while still benefiting from type safety.

Module Support: TypeScript supports modern module formats such as CommonJS, AMD, and ES6 modules. This allows developers to organize their code into reusable modules and manage dependencies more effectively.

These features make TypeScript a powerful tool for building scalable and maintainable JavaScript applications, especially in large codebases and projects where strong typing and advanced language features are beneficial.
