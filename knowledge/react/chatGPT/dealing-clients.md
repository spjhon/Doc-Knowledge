# Dealing With Feelancing or Agency Clients

In the most recent client project i worked on, I asked the client to provide me access to an email address they can control under an alias of `developer@<clientdomain>.com` or similar. If they couldn't, I would have then created them one such as `<clientname>_development@gmail.com`.

Everything was created against that email address. This includes Supabase, Vercel Hosting, Sendgrid, Github, etc. All credentials are stored in a password manager.

I just did my work from there, as you would normally.

I did not provide them the details of the hosting services or credentials until the project was completed. I sent everything in a keepass file once the project was completed and paid for, with instructions on what skills they needed to find to keep maintaining the project should I die or they longer work with me.
